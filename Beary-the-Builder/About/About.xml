  <description>Do you like build base? I like build base.
But lots of events get in way of build base, so I remove them.
	
-Removes annoying events + raids that get in the way of build base
-Good / some neutral events still happen
-[NEW!] difficulty that is more peaceful than peaceful
   
Should be compatible with everything...probably.

Thank you to Mr. Samuel Streamer(youtube) for the Bear artwork and for the wonderful entertainment he shares with us.
