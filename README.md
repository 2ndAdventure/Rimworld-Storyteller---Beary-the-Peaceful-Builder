# Rimworld-Storyteller---Beary-the-Peaceful-Builder

A Rimworld Storyteller + difficulty setting that should hopefully remove raids / other annoying events that get in the way of building.

This shouldn't conflict with other mods, but it also won't add other mod's events unless patches are made for them.

Thank you to Mr. Samuel Streamer(https://www.youtube.com/@MrSamuelStreamer) for the initial bear artwork and for the hours of entertainment.

This is my first Rimworld mod but hopefully it is enjoyable for everyone!
